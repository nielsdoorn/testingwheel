# testingwheel
This project is part of a table-top game for computer science students working on a software project. The goal is to successfully design a test strategy for a software application while encountering and adapting to various assumptions, misconceptions, and changing requirements, reflective of real-world software development.

A central element of the game, this [wheel](https://research.nielsdoorn.nl/testingwheel "The wheel of socrative questions") has various questions related to software testing written on its segments.
